Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is my personal collection of things I’ve done, projects I’ve made, and whatever else I deign to add onto here.

Explore my [[00-09 Brain/02 Digital Garden/Projects/My Projects!\|Projects]]! Lots of Electrical Engineering, Computer/Home-Lab stuff, and half-cooked ideas live in this area.

This is a [[00-09 Brain/02 Digital Garden/Projects/Antenna Design Project\|direct link]] to my most recent project, a Yagi-Uda for my Antenna Theory and Design course.

Here’s my WIP story, [[00-09 Brain/02 Digital Garden/Ambition's Heir/My Story!\|*Ambition’s Heir*]]. 

Finally, here’s some blog-ish style [[00-09 Brain/02 Digital Garden/Thoughts/My Thoughts!\|thoughts]].

Enjoy!,
