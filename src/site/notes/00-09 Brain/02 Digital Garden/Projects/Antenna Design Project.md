*This project is a Work-in_Progress (WIP)*

For ELEN 4130 - Antenna Theory and Design, our semester-long project is to design an antenna (of our choice), build it, and test it according to some target specs.

Some of the specs include:
- A center frequency $f_c$ of 2.4 GHz

There are multiple phases to this project. Phase 1 was to choose an antenna to build, as well as some preliminary research on how to design/build it. Phase 2 was to further research how to design the chosen antenna, as well as submit a report on what we had so far. Phase 3 is to test it, according to the target specs. Phase 4 is to present it. 

I chose a Yagi-Uda antenna
